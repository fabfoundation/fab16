		<h2 class="title">PRACTICAL INFORMATIONS</h2>

		<h3 class="subtitle">Currency and taxes</h3>
		The currency here is the Canadian dollar. A Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 5%, as well as a provincial sales tax (TVQ) of 9.975% are added to goods and services purchased in the province of Québec.
		There is also a 3.5% Tax on Lodging for each accommodation unit rented in an establishment located in the Montréal tourism region.

		<h3 class="subtitle">Converting currency</h3>

		You can convert money at the pricier Pierre Elliot Trudeau Airport currency exchange (not recommended), or at your hotel (even less so), or simply by using your ATM card at any bank, which will charge a small fee (best option). There are also numerous currency exchanges <a href='https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=currency%20exchanges%20downtown%20montreal&rflfq=1&rlha=0&tbm=lcl&tbs=lf:1,lf_ui:2&rlfi=hd:;si:'>located throughout downtown</a> that offer competitive rates.

		<h3 class="subtitle">Tipping at restaurants and elsewhere</h3>

		Service is not included in your restaurant bill. It’s customary to add a 15% tip to the total before taxes (if you’re with a group, a 15-to-18% gratuity may be automatically added to your bill, depending on the establishment). Taxi drivers, delivery workers and hair stylists are also usually tipped 10% to 15%. Porters and doormen typically receive at least $1 per suitcase or service rendered.

		<h3 class="subtitle">Language</h3>

		French is Québec’s official language but english is widely spoken in Montréal. The city has more than 120 cultural groups and almost 30% of population speaks three languages. It is common that you will be addressed in French, but people will quickly speak English when asked.
		
		<h3 class="subtitle">Getting Around Montréal</h3>
		Public transport and taxi are both convenient and affordable ways to get around Montréal. The metro (subway) system is clean, safe and fast. As an added bonus, the public transit network is relatively simple, with just four lines connecting the downtown centre to major tourist sites, bus stops and train stations. The metro operates daily from 5:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. (1:30 a.m. on Saturdays). The average wait time between trains is eight minutes and three minutes during rush hour. If you prefer getting around by taxi, it’s easy to flag one down on the street. You’ll also find them at one of the city’s many taxi stands or in front of most major hotels. A trip to the airport from downtown will cost you a flat rate of CAD 40 - not including tip. Some taxis will also transport bicycles. Renting a BiXi bike is another great and inexpensive alternative.
		
		<h3 class="subtitle">747 YUL AÉROPORT MONTREAL-TRUDEAU/DOWNTOWN SHUTTLE</h3>
		Featuring 24-hour service, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, the 747 shuttle service includes 11 stops in each direction, taking approximately 45 to 70 minutes each way depending on traffic conditions. Wi-Fi service is available on most 747 buses. Buses run frequently, are custom-designed to serve the airport, and are handicap-accessible. Furthermore, for a mere $10 – payable on board (coins only) –, travellers may enjoy unlimited bus and metro access for a 24-hour period.
